        <h2 class="head">A funny story</h2>
        <p class="para">During my first week of arrival in Belgium, I went to attend an info session in a college in Gent.
            When I went to use the bathroom, there I saw two doors without any public signs but with "HEREN" and "DAMES" labels.
            I didn't know what those words mean, so I thought as Nederlands has some similarity with English maybe Heren is from Her, and this is for meant for females.
            So, I went inside the "DAMES" there was nobody. I used the toilet when I was going to wash my hands, a woman entered the bathroom.
            At that moment, I came to know I entered the wrong side.</p>
